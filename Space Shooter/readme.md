The assets for this game are downloaded from the store so they are git ignored. If you would like to clone the game you would need to download the assets from https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/content/13866.

Note: You will probably need to add the DestoryByTime script to all the Explosion objects in Assets/Prefabs/VFX/Explosions. Give them a lifetime of '2' seconds;

Audio for explosions are on the downloaded assets so you might need to redo the sound parts https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/space-shooter-tutorial/audio
